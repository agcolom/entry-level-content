<h1>Using ARIA</h1>
<p>Accessibility is one of the most important aspects of development and one that we don't pay as much attention as we should.</p>
<p>We will look at ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications), what it is and how we can use it in our content to help improve the accessibility of web applications and pages.</p>
<p>We'll also look at ARIA best practices and authoring guidelines. These are particularly suited to custom elements and components we create using Polymer or React-based applications.</p>
<p>As a last step we'll take page we've retrofitted and have it read by Voice Over, the screen reader bundled as part of MacOS X. This will give us an idea of what a user with visual disabilities experiences when they read the content. Yes, I know... This is all Mac. In my defense, that's what I have and what I use the most. If anyone wants to collaborate with a Windows Version, please ping me on Twitter.</p>
